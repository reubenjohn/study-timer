study-timer
Helps you keep pace with your target time

Ever decide that you dont want to spend more than 5 minutes on a page while studying? Sure, but how do you keep track of how much time you have spent on each page? If you have to manually check the time with a stopwatch and calculate how much time you have left, you might even take more time calculating than actual studying ;)

Worry no more! The study-timer is here!
